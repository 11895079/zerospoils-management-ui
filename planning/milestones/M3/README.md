# Milestone M3 — MVP Quality & Shopping

**Objective:** Complete MVP feature set with shopping list, quality assurance, telemetry instrumentation.

**Scope:**
- Reminder preferences and notification integration (180, 190, 200)
- Onboarding polish with Zesto mascot intro and interactive progression (204) — **deferred to M4**
- Date format preference (205)
- Expiry OCR reliability, packaged-item fast add, and barcode/reference-data follow-up (196, 197, 199, 206)
- Haptic and sound scan feedback settings (203)
- Shopping batch capture with receipt-photo attachment for free-tier add flows (198-shopping-batch-receipt-capture)
- Shopping list UI and conversion workflow (210, 220)
- Offline-first verification suite (230)
- Data export/delete for privacy baseline (240)
- Telemetry instrumentation for core funnel (250)
- Feature flags framework (130)
- Firebase integration for mobile tooling (360)
- Localization/i18n strategy (195 - optional)

**Acceptance:** All MVP screens complete; shopping list functional; offline suite passes; telemetry events logging; privacy baseline met; Firebase integrated for crashlytics/feature flags; ready for beta distribution.

**Out of Scope:** Pro tier features (household sync), IoT integrations, full recipe feature, and countertop/fridge goods-photo batch detection. Firebase Firestore/Cloud Functions (using local Hive/sqflite for M3; Supabase for Pro tier in M6).

**Issues:** 130, 180, 190, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 210, 220, 230, 240, 250, 300, 350, 360, 361

**New M3 Features:**
- **Issue 201:** Receipt line-item extraction with AR overlay — excludes HST/GST/totals/card lines; live AR bounding boxes on viewfinder; text panel moved below camera
- **Issue 202:** Fresh produce packaged item recognition — identifies fish, meat, and deli sticker labels; extracts weight, price/kg, pack date, best-before without a separate scanner mode
- **Issue 203:** Haptic and sound feedback settings — persistent per-scanner haptic + beep preferences; receipt scan currently silent; adds POS-style beep to all four scanners; l10n strings already exist
- **Issue 204:** Onboarding polish with Zesto — mascot intro screen, interactive reactions, badge preview, post-onboarding celebration; 7-screen flow with animations and telemetry
- **Issue 300:** Badge system (20 badges) — prerequisite for mascot unlocks
- **Issue 350:** Zesto Phase 1 (10 triggers, anti-spam, storage tips) — interactive mascot companion with educational content
- **Issue 360:** Firebase integration (Crashlytics, Remote Config, FCM) — mobile tooling for crash reporting, feature flags, push notifications (Spark Plan free tier only)
- **Issue 361:** Firebase App Distribution — Tester API integration for beta build delivery and in-app tester feedback collection

**Dependencies:** M2 complete (core screens functional, build pipelines working).

## M3 Implementation Status

**Last Updated:** June 5, 2026 — **Progress:** 22/24 issues complete (92%); 361 (App Distribution) promoted to complete — AppDistributionService implemented, pubspec dep added, both distribute CI workflows in place; 204 and 350 moved to M4; 201/202/203 completed; 206 reference-pack delivery implemented and documented

Note: M3 scope expanded by PR #97 to include three receipt/AR features (201, 202, 361); prior M3 work completed 13 issues; PR #96 added issue 360 (Firebase/FCM).
