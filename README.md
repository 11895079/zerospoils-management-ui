## Quick Start

### 1. Clone & Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bakintunde/zerospoils.git
cd zerospoils

# Install Git hooks (format & lint checks)
bash scripts/setup-hooks.sh      # Linux/macOS
# OR
scripts\setup-hooks.bat           # Windows
```

### 2. Understanding the Codebase (New Developers)

**Start here if you're new to Flutter or this codebase:**

1. **[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)** (12 min read)
   - Overview of clean architecture
   - Key technologies (GoRouter, Riverpod, Hive)
   - How data flows through the app
   - Common patterns explained

2. **[docs/flutter-basics.md](docs/flutter-basics.md)** (8 min read)
   - Dart syntax fundamentals
   - Flutter widget concepts
   - State management basics
   - Hot reload & development tips

3. **[docs/code-patterns.md](docs/code-patterns.md)** (10 min read)
   - Practical patterns with code examples
   - Navigation, state management, UI components
   - Testing patterns
   - Error handling

4. **[docs/gradle-guide.md](docs/gradle-guide.md)** (5 min read)
   - Android build system explanation
   - Common build errors and fixes
   - When you encounter Gradle issues

**Total time: ~35 minutes to fully understand the codebase**

### 3. Planning & Backlog
All backlog grooming, issue definitions, and documentation live in `planning/`. See [planning/README.md](planning/README.md) for:
- Bulk issue creation workflow
- Milestone structure (M1-M7)
- Label/milestone setup scripts

### 4. App Implementation
Implementation happens in `app/` folder. Create feature branches off `main`:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/item-inventory
# ... implement using planning/issues/* as your spec
# ... commit with small, focused PRs
```

**Pre-commit checks:** Format and analyzer checks run automatically before each commit. See [PRE-COMMIT.md](PRE-COMMIT.md) for details.

## Workflow for Implementation

1. **Select Issue** from `planning/milestones/M1/` (or relevant milestone)
2. **Read Issue** – acceptance criteria + test plan are your spec
3. **Create Feature Branch**: `git checkout -b feature/xxx`
4. **Implement in `app/`** – code + tests + telemetry per DoD
5. **Submit PR** linking back to planning issue
6. **Update Issue** status in planning/ when merged

## CI/CD Strategy

- **Planning changes**: Lint markdown, validate issue structure
- **App changes**: Run tests on `app/` path only (don't re-test planning docs)
- **Feature branches**: Small PRs implementing one issue at a time
